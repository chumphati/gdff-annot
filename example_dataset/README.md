## Download<a name="download"></a>

Run the script from the example_dataset folder:

    bash download.sh

A dataset of five strains of <i>Lactoccocus lactis</i> is downloaded in fastq format in a "data" folder created in the current directory. There are four genomes sequenced with Illumina, one genome by ONT and one genome sequenced by both technologies for analysis in hybrid mode.
The file names have been adapted to meet the requirements of the pipeline (see parameters).
Details of these genomes:

A reference in fasta format for the same species can be downloaded: strain LAC460 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NZ_CP059048.1/).

## Launch GDFF-annot<a name="launch"></a>

Run the pipeline on the data folder created with the required parameters:

    gdff-annot --help

Genus and species <i>Lactoccocus lactis</i> can be specified.

An example of a launch command:

    gdff-annot --cluster --results_folder results --tmp_dir results/tmp --data_folder data --genus Lactococcus --species lactis

## Example of a multi-species configuration file<a name="config"></a>

An example of a file generated by generate_multi_species_config.sh and filled in by hand with the necessary information is stored in example_dataset.
